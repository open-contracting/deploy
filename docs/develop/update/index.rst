Change history
--------------

If you don't understand why a configuration exists, it's useful to check its history.

The files in this repository were originally in the `opendataservices-deploy <https://github.com/OpenDataServices/opendataservices-deploy>`__ repository. You can `browse <https://github.com/OpenDataServices/opendataservices-deploy/tree/7a5baff013b888c030df8366b3de45aae3e12f9e>`__ that repository from before the switch (August 5, 2019). That repository was itself re-organized at different times. You can browse `before moving content from *.conf to *.conf.include <https://github.com/OpenDataServices/opendataservices-deploy/tree/4dbea5122e1fc01221c8d051efc99836cef98ccb>`__ (June 5, 2019).
