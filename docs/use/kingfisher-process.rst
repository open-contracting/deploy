Kingfisher Process
==================

Read the `Kingfisher Process <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`__ documentation, which covers general usage.

.. note::

   Is the service unresponsive or erroring? :doc:`Follow these instructions<index>`.

.. _kingfisher-process-review-log-files:

Review log files
----------------

Kingfisher Process writes log messages to the ``/var/log/kingfisher.log`` file. The log file is rotated weekly; last week's log file is at ``/var/log/kingfisher.log.1``, and earlier log files are compressed at ``/var/log/kingfisher.log.2.gz``, etc.

The log files can be read by the ``ocdskfs`` and ``ocdskfp`` users, after :ref:`connecting to the server<connect-process-server>`.

Log messages are formatted as::

    [date] [hostname] %(asctime)s - %(process)d - %(name)s - %(levelname)s - %(message)s

You can filter messages by topic. For example:

.. code-block:: bash

    grep NAME /var/log/kingfisher.log | less

For more information, read Kingfisher Process' `logging documentation <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/logging.html>`__.

Load local data
---------------

**Before** using the `local-load command <https://kingfisher-process.readthedocs.io/en/latest/cli/local-load.html>`__:

#. :ref:`Connect to the main server as the ocdskfp user<connect-process-server>`

#. Change into the ``local-load`` directory:

   .. code:: bash

      cd ~/local-load

#. Create a data directory following the pattern ``source-YYYY-MM-DD-analyst``. For example: ``moldova-2020-04-07-romina``

   -  If the data source is the same as for an `existing spider <https://github.com/open-contracting/kingfisher-collect/tree/master/kingfisher_scrapy/spiders#files>`__, use the same source ID, for example: ``moldova``. Otherwise, use a different source ID that follows our regular pattern ``country[_region][_label]``, for example: ``moldova_covid19``.

#. If you need to download an archive file from a remote URL, prefer ``curl`` to ``wget``, because ``wget`` sometimes writes unwanted files like ``wget-log``.

   -  After unarchiving its contents, you should remove any unnecessary hierarchy from the unarchived files. For example, if all the files are under ``ocds/json``, move the ``json`` directory to the data directory, then remove the ``ocds`` directory.

#. In principle, you should not make changes to the original files. If you need to make changes, put the original and changed files in distinct directories.

**After** using the ``local-load`` command, check whether the data meets the :ref:`data retention policy<data-retention-policy>` below.

   - If so, move the data directory to the ``archive`` directory within the ``local-load`` directory. Remove any changed files.
   - If not, delete the data directory once you're satisfied that it loaded correctly – and at most 90 days after its creation.

To find directories containing data created more than 90 days ago, run:

.. code:: bash

    find -maxdepth 1 -type d ! -name archive -exec bash -c 'if [[ -n $(find {} -ctime +90) ]]; then echo {}; fi' \; | sort

.. _data-retention-policy:

Data retention policy
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

We want to retain newly collected data that is:

-  **Distinct**: The new data is not identical to earlier data.
-  **Complete**: The data is not test data, sample data, or otherwise a subset of the complete dataset.
-  **Clean**: There were few (preferably zero) errors during data collection.

   - Data collection errors include HTTP 500 error responses and Kingfisher Collect exceptions. They don't include errors in the data itself like structural errors.

-  **Periodic**: The data was collected at least 30 days after the most recently retained data for the data source. In other words, we retain at most one collection per month per source.

Whenever we retain data for a given source for the first time in each calendar year, we can delete all but the first collection for that source from the prior year.

In other words, for each source, we will retain at most monthly collections in the last year in which the source was available, and yearly collections otherwise.
