Deployment Guides
-----------------

If you need to perform a specific deployment task, follow the relevant how-to guide. This section focuses on deploying the changes you made in the previous section.

All changes to servers should be made using Salt to ensure that changes are documented and reproducible; changes should not be made manually, which is undocumented and error-prone.
