**Is a service unavailable or unreachable? Are web/SSH requests consistently not responding or timing out?**

If yes, instead of creating a GitHub issue, send a note to sysadmin@open-contracting.org and the relevant server manager (https://ocdsdeploy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/index.html#administrative-access) with the web/SSH address that is unavailable.

**Which service is affected?**

Please provide its name, URL and version (if available).

**What were you trying to do?**

Please list *every* specific step to reproduce the error. Assume the reader is unfamilar with the service. Attach any input data to the issue (you might need to save as TXT or ZIP). If you are working on the command-line, paste the specific commands.

**What error did you receive?**

Please provide the entire output, error message and stacktrace, if available. Do not omit any output, as this will delay resolution. If part of the output is large, attach it to the issue instead (you might need to save as TXT or ZIP).

**What is your environment?**

Where relevant, please provide: web browser name and version, operating system name and version (the precise version like "10.15.6", not the major version like "Catalina") and/or Python version.

**Did you attempt a fix?**

If so, please describe what you did.

**How soon do you need a fix?**
